## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- UV package manager (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd agentic-ai-engineering
```

2. Install dependencies using UV:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
uv shell
```

### Running Projects

Each week's projects can be run independently. Navigate to the specific directory and follow the instructions in the README files or Jupyter notebooks.

For example, to run the CrewAI debate system:

```bash
cd 03-crewai/01-debate
crewai run
```
